# CSS Animation Standards

## Animation Guidelines
- Use keyframe animations for complex effects
- Combine multiple animations using comma separation
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Prefer transform and opacity for performance

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive keyframe names (spinAndSlide, colorShift, buttonPulse)
- Use BEM-style class names when adding new components
- Keep animation durations consistent with existing timing

## Color Schemes
- Use gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Implement rainbow/spectrum effects for text and borders
- Maintain accessibility with sufficient contrast ratios
