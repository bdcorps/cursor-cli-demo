# React Development Standards

## Component Architecture
- Use functional components with React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Follow React 18+ best practices including StrictMode usage
- Maintain single responsibility principle for components
- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript syntax

## State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Implement proper state updates with functional updates when needed
- Follow React's unidirectional data flow principles
- Example from [App.js](mdc:src/App.js): `const [isHello, setIsHello] = useState(false);`

## Event Handling
- Use arrow functions for event handlers to avoid binding issues
- Implement proper event delegation where applicable
- Follow the pattern established in the toggle functionality

## Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Implement proper JSX formatting
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
