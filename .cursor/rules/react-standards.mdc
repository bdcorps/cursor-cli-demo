# React JavaScript Standards

## State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
- Follow the existing pattern of toggle functionality
- Keep state simple and focused

## Component Structure  
- Use functional components with hooks
- Export components as default exports
- Import React and required hooks at the top

## Event Handlers
- Use descriptive names like `toggleText`, `handleClick`
- Keep event handlers simple and focused
- Use arrow functions for inline handlers when appropriate
